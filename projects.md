Algoholics host 2 development teams Twisties and Palladians. Each of the teams consists of members of the community with a passion for open source development and providing services which help all of us learn. The teams are in charge of the following projects:

[Twister](https://github.com/algoholics-ntua/Twister) serves as an social automated service for mock techincal coding interviews. 

[Palladium](https://github.com/algoholics-ntua/Palladium) on the other hand is an interactive hacky-algorithmic game. It is puzzle oriented and you need to combine your technical and logical skills to complete it.

Feel free to pick up one of the issues and join us on the discord server to actively participate in one of the development teams.
